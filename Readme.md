Custom Cards aggregate all abilities among the selected units into 2 cards: 
- Abilities the player may use when a unit is activated (and also when the unit perform some bonus action, such as "Tactical Network" from Kalani, for example)
- Abilities the player may use when the selected unit is the target of an attack

The purpose of Custom cards is to display only the relevant abilities and hide unecessary information.
It won't play or decide for you but it ensure that you are not forgetting synergies from your list.
